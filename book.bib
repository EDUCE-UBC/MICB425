	Abstract = {Oxygen is an important organizing principle in marine ecosystems. As oxygen levels decline, energy is increasingly diverted away from higher trophic levels into microbial community metabolism causing changes in carbon and nutrient cycling. Here we use metagenomic and metaproteomic methods to chart in situ metabolic networks linking key microbial players driving carbon and nutrient cycling in a seasonally stratified fjord, Saanich Inlet, a model ecosystem for studying microbial responses to changing levels of water column oxygen deficiency. Based on this evidence, we develop a conceptual model that describes coupling of chemotrophic energy production with dark carbon fixation along defined redox gradients with implications for primary production and possibly carbon sedimentation in expanding marine oxygen minimum zones.Marine oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are intrinsic water column features arising from respiratory oxygen demand during organic matter degradation in stratified waters. Currently OMZs are expanding due to global climate change with resulting feedback on marine ecosystem function. Here we use metaproteomics to chart spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression along defined redox gradients in a seasonally stratified fjord to better understand microbial community responses to OMZ expansion. The expression of metabolic pathway components for nitrification, anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), denitrification, and inorganic carbon fixation were differentially expressed across the redoxcline and covaried with distribution patterns of ubiquitous OMZ microbes including Thaumarchaeota, Nitrospina, Nitrospira, Planctomycetes, and SUP05/ARCTIC96BD-19 Gammaproteobacteria. Nitrification and inorganic carbon fixation pathways affiliated with Thaumarchaeota dominated dysoxic waters, and denitrification, sulfur oxidation, and inorganic carbon fixation pathways affiliated with the SUP05 group of nitrate-reducing sulfur oxidizers dominated suboxic and anoxic waters. Nitrifier nitrite oxidation and anammox pathways affiliated with Nirospina, Nitrospira, and Planctomycetes, respectively, also exhibited redox partitioning between dysoxic and suboxic waters. The numerical abundance of SUP05 proteins mediating inorganic carbon fixation under anoxic conditions suggests that SUP05 will become increasingly important in global ocean carbon and nutrient cycling as OMZs expand.},

	Abstract = {Modern molecular sequencing is beginning to provide great insight into microbial community structure and function at ecosystem scales. However, the quantitative integration of multiomic sequence information (DNA, mRNA, and protein) and geochemical processes has so far been elusive. Here, we develop a biogeochemical model that integrates geochemistry and multiomic sequence information to explain key metabolic processes in the oxygen-starved waters of Saanich Inlet, a model ecosystem for studying microbial community responses to oxygen minimum zone expansion. Our model largely explains DNA, mRNA, and protein distributions and sheds light on the metabolic networks coupling carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen transformations across a redox gradient. Our approach is extensible to other biogeochemical models incorporating feedbacks of global change on ecosystem functions.Microorganisms are the most abundant lifeform on Earth, mediating global fluxes of matter and energy. Over the past decade, high-throughput molecular techniques generating multiomic sequence information (DNA, mRNA, and protein) have transformed our perception of this microcosmos, conceptually linking microorganisms at the individual, population, and community levels to a wide range of ecosystem functions and services. Here, we develop a biogeochemical model that describes metabolic coupling along the redox gradient in Saanich Inlet{\textemdash}a seasonally anoxic fjord with biogeochemistry analogous to oxygen minimum zones (OMZs). The model reproduces measured biogeochemical process rates as well as DNA, mRNA, and protein concentration profiles across the redox gradient. Simulations make predictions about the role of ubiquitous OMZ microorganisms in mediating carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling. For example, nitrite {\textquotedblleft}leakage{\textquotedblright} during incomplete sulfide-driven denitrification by SUP05 Gammaproteobacteria is predicted to support inorganic carbon fixation and intense nitrogen loss via anaerobic ammonium oxidation. This coupling creates a metabolic niche for nitrous oxide reduction that completes denitrification by currently unidentified community members. These results quantitatively improve previous conceptual models describing microbial metabolic networks in OMZs. Beyond OMZ-specific predictions, model results indicate that geochemical fluxes are robust indicators of microbial community structure and reciprocally, that gene abundances and geochemical conditions largely determine gene expression patterns. The integration of real observational data, including geochemical profiles and process rate measurements as well as metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic sequence data, into a biogeochemical model, as shown here, enables holistic insight into the microbial metabolic network driving nutrient and energy flow at ecosystem scales.},

@article{Hawley2017,
	Abstract = {Marine oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are widespread regions of the ocean that are currently expanding due to global warming. While inhospitable to most metazoans, OMZs are hotspots for microbial mediated biogeochemical cycling of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur, contributing disproportionately to marine nitrogen loss and climate active trace gas production. Our current understanding of microbial community responses to OMZ expansion is limited by a lack of time-resolved data sets linking multi-omic sequence information (DNA, RNA, protein) to geochemical parameters and process rates. Here, we present six years of time-resolved multi-omic observations in Saanich Inlet, a seasonally anoxic fjord on the coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada that undergoes recurring changes in water column oxygenation status. This compendium provides a unique multi-omic framework for studying microbial community responses to ocean deoxygenation along defined geochemical gradients in OMZ waters.},
