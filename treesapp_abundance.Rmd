# Calculating relative abundance of meta'omic data

## Overview

Genome assemblies are lossy. Whenever you assemble a (meta)genome from reads, the abundance information is effectively lost, even if it is noted in the FASTA headers by some assemblers. One way to recover these read-level abundances is by aligning the reads back to the contigs and calculating the number of reads that mapped to each. One can go a step further still and use relative abundance normalization measures popular in transcriptomics, such as fragments per kilobase per million mappable reads (FPKM) or transcripts per million (TPM) @Wagner.2012.

TreeSAPP's subcommand `abundance` is capable of calculating FPKM or TPM for all classified query sequences. These can be derived from the FASTQ files of multiple different samples. This is only possible when the input contained nucleotide sequences from which ORFs were predicted within the pipeline.


There are two required arguments for `treesapp abundance`:

1.  **treesapp_output**: Path to the output directory from `treesapp assign`.
2.  **reads**: Path to a FASTQ file containing single-end reads, or foward mates or interleaved reads from a paired-end sequencing library.

Below are descriptions for the most important options:

1.  **reverse**: Path to a FASTQ file containing reverse mates from a paired-end sequencing library.
2.  **report**: This argument controls what `treesapp abundance` does with the resulting abundance values. The '*nothing*' option is most applicable to the Python API, and is used by `treesapp assign` to simply return the abundance object instances. '*update*' can be used when the abundance values in the classification table should be replaced with these newly calculated values. '*append*' should be used when reads of new samples are being used to calculate abundance (e.g. reads from a time-course experiment).
3.  **metric**: Either Fragments per Kilobase per Mllion mappable reads (FPKM) or Transcripts per Million (TPM).

## Workflow description

The workflow employed by TreeSAPP is relatively simple and common to many bioinformatics pipelines:

1.  Collect nucleotide sequences for the classified ORFs.
2.  BWA @Li.2013 creates an index from these nucleotide sequences - this will be the reference database.
3.  Align the short reads to the reference database with BWA MEM.
4.  Calculate the relative abundance metrics using [samsum](https://github.com/hallamlab/samsum).

There are potentially two common use cases for `treesapp abundance`.

1.  Through `treesapp assign` where a single sample's read data are mapped to its corresponding assembly (i.e. contigs or scaffolds) and the relative abundances of these sequences are obtained.
2.  A combined assembly was generated from multiple samples, classified with `treesapp assign`, then the reads of each sample were mapped individually to generate sample-specific relative abundance values with `treesapp abundance`.

## Outputs

The sole output of `treesapp abundance` is an edited classification table, previously generated by `treesapp assign`. No new files are generated, beyond intermediates.

## Tutorial steps

### Classification table

Back on the server, let's look at TreeSAPP's classification table for these FunGene XmoA sequences.

The classification table contains detailed information corresponding to each classified query sequence. It is a tab-delimited table that can be read by a variety of tools. I tend to analyze most data in R and so the classification table was designed to be compatible with the tidyverse's extensive toolset. Likewise, it should be similarly easy to use Python to analyze these data with its rich suite of visualization libraries, e.g., `plotly` and `matplotlib`.

## Use your group's reference package to calculate abundances

Continue to work with your group's reference package in the directory `/data/<gene name>`. Visualize the appropriate outputs with iTOL.
