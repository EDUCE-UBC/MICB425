# The Saanich Inlet data set

## Description 

We will work with real-world data collected as part of an ongoing oceanographic time series program in Saanich Inlet, a seasonally anoxic fjord on the East coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia:

```{r saanich-inlet, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "The Saanich Inlet"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/saanich_inlet_map.png")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:saanich-inlet) shows a map of Saanich Inlet indicating conventional sample collection stations (S1-S9). The data used in this tutorial (sourced from S3, Cruise 72) include various geochemical measurements and the genomic and transcriptomic data of microbial samples at depths 10, 100, 120, 135, 150, 165 and 200 m.

For more details about these data, see @Hallam.2017, and for more detailed information on the environmental context and time series data, see @Torres-Beltrán.2017.

## Data on the server

The data is located on the MICB425 server at `/mnt/datasets/saanich/`.

```{r echo = FALSE, comment = NA}
cat(paste(readLines("data/directory_structure.txt"),
          collapse = "\n"),
    fill = TRUE)
```

## Methods

Water was collected from various depths at Saanich Inlet and filtered through a 0.22 µm Sterivex filter to collect biomass. Total genomic DNA and RNA were extracted from these filters. RNA was reversed transcribed into cDNA and both genomic DNA and cDNA were used in the construction of shotgun Illumina libraries. Sequencing data were generated on the Illumina HiSeq platform with **2x150bp** technology. For more in-depth sampling and sequencing methods, please see @Hawley.2017.

### Quality filtering of reads

The resulting reads were processed and quality controlled at the Joint Genome Institute using the IMG/M pipeline. 

Quality filtering was performed with Trimmomatic (v.0.35, [documentation](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic)) @Bolger.2014 with default parameters except:

```
LEADING:3 
TRAILING:3 
SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 
MINLEN:36
```

### Assembly

MEGAHIT (v.1.1.3, [documentation](https://github.com/voutcn/megahit/wiki/Assembly-Tips)) @Li.2015 assembled MAGs using with default parameters except for:

```
--k-min 27 
--k-step 10 
--min-contig-len 500
```
