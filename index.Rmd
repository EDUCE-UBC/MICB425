# Overview {-}

This document introduces bioinformatics workflows useful in gene-centric mapping of functional and phylogenetic anchors encoded in microbial genomes sourced from natural and engineered environments.  

-   Part I outlines the motivation and insights afforded by the use of these workflows to study uncultivated microbial community structure and function.
-   Part II provides hands-on tutorials to learn two effective tools for gene-centric analysis, TreeSAPP and iTOL.
-   Part III described your capstone project to explore primary metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data collected from the Saanich Inlet water column spanning a defined nutrient and energy gradient.
