# A tutorial for using TreeSAPP

You will work through a common workflow of TreeSAPP in a series of tutorials both with an example gene (XmoA) to familiarize yourself with the tools and then you will repeat the steps with a gene assigned to your group for which no reference package has ever been created. You will document your steps for the new reference package in Problem Set 5.

## A typical TreeSAPP workflow

-   [Acquiring golden data].
-   [Creating a Reference Package For TreeSAPP].
-   [Classifying unknown sequences with TreeSAPP and updating a reference package].
-   [Calculating relative abundance of meta'omic data].

## Genes for used for creating reference packages

### XmoA

The protein family we will be focusing on is that of the copper-containing membrane-bound monooxygenases @Khadka.2018. This family contains particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) and ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) and well be building a reference package for the alpha subunits of these enzymes called XmoA. All groups will work through this example.

### Group-assigned genes

You will created a reference package and perform the other steps only for the gene that has been assigned to you.

```{r message = FALSE}
readr::read_tsv("data/new_refpkgs.tsv")
```

## Tools

### Shell

Please review previous tutorials. Use this short [cheat sheet](#shell-cheat-sheet) for commonly used commands.

### TreeSAPP

Tree-based Sensitive and Accurate Phylogenetic Profiler (TreeSAPP) @Morgan-Lang.2020 can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/hallamlab/TreeSAPP) including an excellent [wiki](https://github.com/hallamlab/TreeSAPP/wiki) with additional information on each of the `treesapp` subcommands.

We also provide you with a list of existing [TreeSAPP reference packages].

### iTOL

Interactive Tree Of Life ([iTOL](https://itol.embl.de/)) @Letunic.2019 is a browser -based tool that allows you to visualize data generated in TreeSAPP as a phylogenetic tree with additional annotations.

## Data

You will use [The Saanich Inlet data set].
